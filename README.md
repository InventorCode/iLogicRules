## About

This is an unofficial collection of iLogic/Visual Basic snippets and rules for Autodesk Inventor.

## How to Use

This repo is simple a collection of code.  You can browse the directory structure for files that look useful to you.  The organizational file structure will undoubtably evolve, but the current organization of this repo is organized by folder.  Each folder should reflect a specific area of interest within Inventor.  Examples include:

* Snippets - portions of code with a specific task, such as turning off/on user screen interaction.
* Drawing File rules
* Assembly File rules
* File Management fules
* Sketch rules

## Languages

The languages included in this repo are vb.net and iLogic (which is a specific subset of vb.net for use inside Autodesk Inventor).

## Documentation

There is no dedicated documentation for this repo at the moment.  Dig into the code and look around.

## Branch Guidance

*Master* will be the main repository branch; this branch will contain the most up-to-date code.  All short-lived branches will be merged back into *Main*.
The following branch naming guidelines should be observed for short-lived branches...

* username/xx
* addition/xx
* bugfix/xx
* issue/xx

Users are urged to use pull requests to merge into *Master*, instead of directly pushing to master.  This should foster discussion about the proposed merges.
